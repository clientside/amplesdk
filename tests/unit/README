 Ample SDK - JavaScript GUI Framework
 http://www.amplesdk.com
 ------------------------------------

 This folder contains unit tests to be run with JsUnit testing framework.
 - unit.html files in folders contain tests
 - suite.html files in folders contain test suites
 Note! The JsUnit framework used was tweaked (in two locations) in order to
       support relative paths in urls.

 Running:
 - Access tests/jsunit/testRunner.html?testpage=../unit/suite.html&autorun=true

 Adjusting:
 - By default unit tests will run against raw source version.
   If you want to run tests against build version, create build first, then
   point directory in jsUnitClient.js file to the relative build folder location:
   var sBaseUriAmple	= '../../build/work/ample-0.9.0/ample/';
