	<title>Part II - Creating custom Component</title>
	<abstract>
		<locale>
			This tutorial will guide you through a series of steps explaining how you create
			a custom Element Component and use it in your application.
			For the practical purpose we will take well-known component "spinner" as a good use case in this tutorial.
			Before starting to read this document, please be sure you've read <a href="create_language.xml">Part I - Creating custom Markup Language</a>.

			Before starting implementation of a component you usually go through
			the design phase where following areas should be tackled:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Visual Design - How shall component look</li>
			<li>Interaction Design - How shall component behave upon user interaction</li>
			<li>Functional Design - What API (properties, methods and events) shall component implement</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Now, assume the design phase has been undergone and we know well what our "spinner" component is going to be.

				<locale>Defining constructor</locale>
			</title>
			<content>
				<locale>
					<p>
						The constructor is usually used in order to instantiate component collections that, for example,
						keep XHTML form elements children in the "elements" property or to initialize some private properties.
						Note, the component is not part of the application tree at the moment when constructor is called,
						thus it does not make any good sense to try and access its DOM properties. Also, the component
						visuals are not created by this moment either, so interacting with them would result into a run-time exception.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the spinner component constructor we do not need to do anything, thus its body is left empty.

					Defining presentation
				</locale>
			</title>
			<content>
				<locale>
					<p>
						The visual presentation of a component (that is usually referred to as shadow tree) is usually
						created in pure HTML. This part of the component lives its own life in the browser's DOM.
						The template for the shadow tree is created with JavaScript (opposed to, for example, <link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xbl">XBL 2.0</link>
						technology where it gets specified in XML) with help of <b>$getTagOpen</b> and <b>$getTagClose</b> members.
					</p>
			<code><![CDATA[
MySpinner.prototype.$getTagOpen		= function() {
	var sOpenTag	= '<div class="my-spinner ' + this.getAttribute("class") + '">' +
						'<input class="my-spinner--input" type="text" autocomplete="off"'
							' value="'+	this.getAttribute("value") + '"' +
							' onchange="ample.$getElementByAnonymousContent(this)._onChange(event)"/>' +
						'<button class="my-spinner--button-up"/>' +
						'<button class="my-spinner--button-down"/>';

	return sOpenTag;
};

MySpinner.prototype.$getTagClose	= function() {
	var sCloseTag	= '</div>';

	return sCloseTag;
};
			]]></code>
					<p>
						There is several important things highlighted here:
						<ul>
							<li>Attribute values are rendered directly into the shadow content</li>
							<li>Pseudo-elements specified with special class attribute syntax <b>{prefix}-{localName}--{pseudoElement}</b></li>
							<li>Handlers bound to the Ample DOM element instance inline</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						If an element is not expected to take any child tags on the page, usage of <b>$getTagOpen</b>/<b>$getTagClose</b> pair
						can be changed to a specification of a single <b>$getTag</b> method, whose default implementation is to call two aforementioned
						tags and merge their output into single string.

					Defining attributes default values
				</locale>
			</title>
			<content>
				<locale>
					<p>
						A component often has attributes that are normally responsible for keeping its state.
						Attributes might have default values, whose specification can be done on a component
						<b>attributes</b> static property.
					</p>
			<code><![CDATA[
MySpinner.attributes	= {
	min:	"0",
	max:	"9",
	step:	"1",
	value:	"0"
};

					Defining properties/methods
				</locale>
			</title>
			<content>
				<locale>
					<p>
						Properties are opposed to attributes, and it is not that simple to explain when to use what.
						The common practice (if you take XUL or XHTML markup languages' elements) is to have component properties
						duplicating all attributes while leaving application developer with a recommendation to interact with properties.
						Within Ample SDK framework it is recommended not to use properties for public APIs at all, since it is not
						possible in every browser to define proper properties handling mechanisms (setters/getters).
						Still your component can have properties enabled although [mutually] read-only ones. An example - <b>selectedIndex</b>
						property of some selection-based component.
						Methods are always valuable. For example, you could have a method <b>close()</b> on a "window" component (although, note,
						this same functionality could have been enabled by implementing <b>open</b> attribute)
					</p>
					<p>
						In case with our "spinner" component, we definitely need <b>select</b> method and we can also have <b>value</b>
						property that will keep the value as Number.
					</p>

MySpinner.prototype.value	= 0;

MySpinner.prototype.select	= function() {
	this.$getContainer("input").select();

					Dispatching events
				</locale>
			</title>
			<content>
				<locale>
					<p>
						A component dispatches an event usually when its state changes.
						For example, an XHTML input component dispatches "change" event once it value changed.
					</p>
					<p>
						In case of our "spinner" component we shall dispatch a <b>change</b> event as well upon the
						component state change. The event has to bubble and should not be preventable
						(since it gets dispatched after change has taken place).
					</p>
			<code><![CDATA[
var oEvent	= this.ownerDocument.createEvent("Event");
oEvent.initEvent("change", true, false);
this.dispatchEvent(oEvent);

					Implementing events default actions
				</locale>
			</title>
			<content>
				<locale>
					<p>
						A component while running in the Ample SDK execution container gets notified with events
						coming from the other components and distributing through the DOM tree as well as with a set of
						generic events defined in DOM-Events-Level-3 specification. Although component instance can
						have multiple instance-level event handlers associated (registered with "on..." attributes or
						by calling <b>addEventListener</b> method), it is also possible to specify component class-level
						handlers. These often can be referred to as events default actions implementations. You can specify
						class-level event handlers by defining a <b>handlers</b> static property on the component class and
						registering event handlers by their names with it.
					</p>
			<code><![CDATA[
MySpinner.handlers   = {
	"DOMAttrModified":	function(oEvent) {
		if (oEvent.target == this) {
			switch (oEvent.attrName) {
				case "value":
					// Set public property to reflect the state
					this.value	= oEvent.attrValue * 1;
					// Update input field
					this.$getContainer("input").value	= oEvent.attrValue;
					// Dispatch "change" event here
					break;
			}
		}
	},
	"keydown":	function(oEvent) {
		var nValue	= this.getAttribute("value") * 1,
			nStep	= this.getAttribute("step") * 1;
		switch (oEvent.keyIdentifier) {
			case "Up":
				if (nValue + nStep <= this.getAttribute("max") * 1)
					this.setAttribute("value", nValue + nStep);
				break;

			case "Down":
				if (nValue - nStep >= this.getAttribute("min") * 1)
					this.setAttribute("value", nValue - nStep);
				break;
		}

					Styling component
				</locale>
			</title>
			<content>
				<locale>
					<p>
						Ample SDK enables styling facilities by implementing CSS features, such as namespaces,
						pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. In order to make use of those, you will need to
						specify different mime-type for your stylesheets on your pages, namely <b>text/ample+css</b>.
					</p>
			<code type="application/xml"><![CDATA[
<link type="text/ample+css" href="style.css"/>
<style type="text/ample+css">
/*
	Inline stylesheet
*/
</style>
			]]></code>
					<p>
						In these stylesheets you can define rules in a standard manner:
					</p>
			<code type="text/css"><![CDATA[
@import namespace url('http://www.mybusiness.com/ns/ui');

my|spinner {
	border: solid 1px blue;
}
my|spinner::input {
	border: none;
	color:	black;
	background:	transparent;
}
my|spinner::button-up,
my|spinner::button-down {
	background-image:	url('media/spinner.gif');
	background-repeat:	no-repeat;
	height: 8px;
	width:	16px;
}
my|spinner::button-down {
	background-position-x: -16px;
}
my|spinner::button-up:hover,
my|spinner::button-down:hover {
	background-position-y: -8px;
}
my|spinner::button-up:active,
my|spinner::button-down:active {
	background-position-y: -16px;
}

my|spinner::button-up:disabled,
my|spinner::button-down:disabled {
	background-position-y: -24px;
}
			]]></code>
					<p>
						The pseudo-elements (whose names appear after <b>::</b> selector)
						classes will be applied to elements in the shadow tree that had their
						pseudo-elements defined by providing a corresponding class name, for example: my-spinner--button-up.
						The pseudo-classes are set by the component at the run-time by calling <b>$setPseudoClass</b> element method.
