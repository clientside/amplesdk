			This tutorial will guide you through a series of steps explaining how you create
			a custom Markup Language and register it with Ample SDK Framework.

						First you create an instance of AMLNamespace object (please note the difference from how a new
						element is defined). This object is going to host all elements and global attributes defined
						in the language namespace.

					<p>
						Next you register your language with Ample SDK framework.
						Here you need to specify namespace URI, a token that you will use
						in your UI XML fragments when referring to your components. The token can actually be anything
						(including empty string) however it is strongly recommended that you use
						unique identifiers, that does neither collide with other domains in your business, nor with any third-parties' businesses.
						A common practice here is to use your business domain name with an additional path items clustering your needs.
						(Compare: <uri>http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events</uri>, <uri>http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul</uri>, <uri>http://www.amplesdk.com/ns/aml</uri>, etc.)

ample.domConfig.setNamespace("http://www.mybusiness.com/ns/ui", MyNamespace);

					Defining an Element Component

					<p>
						An element component definition is a class that will be instantiated when it is referred from a UI page.
						That is why when defining component you should use a function constructor (please
						note a difference from how a language defined). The prototype chain of the constructor should be set
						to an instance of AMLElement so that all base DOM functionality available from that object would get
						inherited to the newly defined component.
						In the example given below you can see a simple skeleton of a component.
					</p>
			<code><![CDATA[
// Define component constructor
var MySuggestBox	= function() {

}

// Define component prototype
MySuggestBox.prototype	= new AMLElement;

// Define component members
MySuggestBox.prototype.value	= '';
MySuggestBox.prototype.setValue	= function(sValue) {

}

					Registering Element Component with Language implementation
				</locale>
			</title>
			<content>
				<locale>
					<p>
						The last step you need to undertake in order to get your component recognized by
						the framework is to register it with the language defined above.
						Here you should pass in a component name identifier (or simply token) by which your
						component will be looked when referencing from your UI XML fragments.
					</p>
			<code><![CDATA[
MyNamespace.setElement("suggestbox", MySuggestBox);
			]]></code>

					<p>
						Now your component is pretty much ready to use and can be used from within UI.
						Note, that you will not see any visual representation of your newly created
						Element Component yet, as we did not create one.
