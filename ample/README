This folder contains raw source of the Ample SDK framework.

When project is built the folders contents get concatenated
into single files representing implementation of runtime and
languages.

For development purposes there is a simple mechanism implemented
that invloves Apache's mod_rewrite to redirect requests for final
files to a respectful PHP scripts that concatenate folders contents
into single files on the fly. If you are using different web-server
or/and different server-side language, you may want to look into
the .htaccess file and PHP script and implement similar glueing
mechanisms for the platform of your choice.
